 Need a small library that will hook into GitHub (mostly implemented in the GitConnection of BTools) to submit packages and also check what's available via the PacletServerBuilder package in BTools.

Similar to something I did before, but to be able to do this is a light-weight manner would be wonderful. If it's possible to do without cloning that'd be the best.

Hopefully this can be done by forking in GitHub (after checking if a fork is necessary) then submitting the paclet to the Review Queue via the upload file API function.
