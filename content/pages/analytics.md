# Paclet Server Analytics Report

![Analytics Report]({filename}/img/analytics/users.png)

This provides base page view analytics for the server. The raw analytics data may also be obtained from  [analytics_dataset.wl](https://paclets.github.io/PacletServer/analytics_dataset.wl) . I don't think this is a GDPR violation, but if so  *please* let us know and I'll remove all of this.

## Page View Timeseries

This is the total page view breakdown as a  [```TimeSeries```](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TimeSeries.html) . It is also broken down for the nine paclet pages with the most page views overall.

Other analytics will be coming and will be generated when the server is rebuilt. If you have any specific requests those may be made in the comments on this page
