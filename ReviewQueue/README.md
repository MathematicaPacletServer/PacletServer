This directory is where to put your paclet or project when you want it to be added to the paclet server.

You can either leave a packed .paclet file, a sole .m file, or a project folder set up as a  [Mathematica application](https://reference.wolfram.com/workbench/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.wolfram.eclipse.help%2Fhtml%2Ftasks%2Fapplications%2Fapplications.html)  you don't need to add the PacletInfo.m file but it is highly recommended.

If you use the  [BTools AppBuilder package](https://github.com/b3m2a1/mathematica-BTools/blob/master/project/examples/Paclets.md)  to make your packages this will be automatically configured for you.

***Important note***

*Don't pick a paclet name that will collide with the paclets already on the server*.

Distinctive names ensure there is the least chance of a collision.
